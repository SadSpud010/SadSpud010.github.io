<h1> Project 1 Game Design </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The game that we made was a simple platformer created in Construct 3. I have no experience in creating games in Construct 3 but my group members have made a few games in Construct 2 before. The game is simply a platform situated in different positions in which the character would move across and an end platform. </p>
<h2> Objectives </h2>
<ul> 
	<li> 	Make a simple game in Construct 3 to learn how it works </li>
	<li>	Create sprite and background for experience on how to import them into games </li>
	<li>	Learn how to animate sprites in games </li>
	<li>	Gain an understanding on how making games works </li>
</ul>
<h2> Results </h2>

	<p> We made these before the game so we may have spent too much time on them instead of coding the game. The game used the one platform in different angles to act as a path for the character to walk along. As we hadn’t had the time, most the animation sprites were not used and the character just glided along. The final platform was mainly just a flat platform with a flag on it. If we had the time we would’ve used the victory sprite to show that you had reached the end of the level.</p>
<h2> Process and Planning </h2> 
<p> We had originally decide to use a template to work from but we couldn’t get the character moving so we restarted. The program we used was Construct 3 in which none of us had any experience in. Luckily though, it is very similar to Construct 2 which Sam and Dean had used last year for their games. </p>
<h2> Discussion </h2>
<p> The main problem we had was needing to restart from scratch as we had problems with using a template to build our game around. We could have made a much more in-depth game by adding enemies, a respawn, more levels and an animation for completing the level. We had all the animation frames ready to use but we ran out of time to put them in. We could’ve added another level as we had a spare background to use but we didn’t quite get up to doing it.</p>
